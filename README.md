# The Vocal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio, reimagined. This project is a complete portfolio website designed to showcase my skills and projects, with one unique feature: **full voice-based navigation.**

You can browse the entire site, from the "About Me" section to my "Projects" and "Contact" page, using only your voice. This project combines a modern React frontend with a powerful Python backend that handles speech-to-text processing and command interpretation.

* **Development:**
    * Git & GitHub
    * VS Code

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)
* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

    cd The-Vocal-Portfolio
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd Backend

    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install the required Python packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Run the backend server
    python server.py
    ```
    The backend server will now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    * Open a **new terminal window**.
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
    cd Frontend

    # Install the required npm packages
    npm install

    # Run the frontend development server
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

4.  **Open the app!**
    Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. You may need to grant the site microphone permissions.
